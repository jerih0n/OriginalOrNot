##Original or Not

Text comparison software

#Short Discription

OriginalOrNot is a free open source software, designed to locate and show equal words between two files. The 
software is designed to be used with large text files, like articles, a collection of articles and novels, but of 
course, can be used for far smaller files. The key point of the software is the speed, of comparison, and the 
feature of Intersection - creating a new file in .docx format with all of the words that are equal between the two 
text files. If there are equal sentences, paragraphs, and even entire parts, they will appear in the newly created 
file, and easily can be located, and can prove plagiarism
